\title{An add Spec to library function
This function recieves a library object created by the CreateLibFromMGF function and a spectrum which is to be added to the library. It returns library with the new spectrum added.}
\usage{
addSpecToLibrary(library, Spec, D_MS = 0.04, D_MSMS = 0.04,
  MIN_PEAK_COUNT = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{library}{A spectral library for Spectrum addition}

\item{Spec}{A spectrum to be added to library. A single entity for an MGF object.}

\item{D_MS}{a maximal difference between precoursor masses of two spectra for them to be considered the same. Defaults to 0.04.}

\item{D_MSMS}{a maximal difference between fragmentation spectra peaks' masses from them to be considered the same. Delaults to 0.04.}

\item{MIN_PEAK_COUNT}{a minimal number of correlating peaks between two spactra for them to be consideredd the same. Defaults to 5.}
